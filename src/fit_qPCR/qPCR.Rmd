  The purpose of this document is to specify a generative model for qPCR data which captures
  a realistic data generating process sufficiently to outperform the "standard curve" simple
  linear regression approach. We anticipate the majority of the performance benefit will
  be when there are few initial virus copies, close to the limit of detection (LOD).

## Background

* Many factors impact the absolute value of $C_t$ besides the concentration of the target
* Artefacts from the reaction mix or instrument can change the fluoresence measurements
* Fluorescence emission of any molecule depends on environmental factors (pH, salt concentration)
* Rn is a measure of fluorescence, calculated as a ratio of the FAM dye to ROX dye
* $\Delta$Rn is Rn minus the baseline fluorescence
* $C_q$ is the cycle number at which the amplification curve intersects some threshold line

## The standard curve method

$$
C_q = a + b\log_{10}(\text{copies per ml})
$$

Key relationship is that alterations of the number of copies by factors of ten should result in the same additive change in $C_q$.

## Copy amplification

Suppose that there are initially $n_0 \in \mathbb{N}^+$ copies of the virus and the number of copies during amplification at cycle $c \in \mathbb{N}^+$ is $n_c$.
Amplification typically results in a logistic curve which may be described by parameteric models.
Two possible strategies for analysing this curve: (1) only model the exponential component, (2) model the complete curve [@ritz2008qpcr].

In the first strategy, the exponential component must be isolated by some method.
Onlt then, it can be modelled according to e.g.
$$
n_c = n_0 (1 + E)^c
$$
where the efficiency $E$ may have a prior centered at one.
We will not take this approach for the time being.
Note that the first derivative is
$$
\frac{\text{d}n_c}{\text{d}c} = n_0 \log(1 + E) (1 + E)^c
$$



Alternatively it is possible to model the complete curve.
We consider two possible models.
The four-parameter logistic model (4PL) is of the form
$$
n_c = n_\infty + \frac{n_0 - n_\infty}{\left(1 + (c / m)^b \right)}
$$
where $n_\infty = \lim_{t \to \infty} n_c$ is the asympotote of the curve at infinity, and $n_0 = \lim_{t \to 0} n_c$ is the estimated initial number of copies, $b$ is the slope and $m$ is the midpoint (see "[generalised logistic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_logistic_function)").
The first derivative of $n_c$ is
$$
\frac{\text{d}n_c}{\text{d}c} = - (n_0 - n_{\inf}) \frac{1}{\left(1 + (c / m)^b \right)^2} b \frac{c^{b - 1}}{m^b}.
$$
Evaluating this at the midpoint, $m$, gives
$$
\frac{\text{d}n_c}{\text{d}c} \rvert_{c = m} = - (n_0 - n_{\inf}) \cdot \frac{b}{4m} = \frac{(n_{\inf} - n_0)}{4m} \cdot b,
$$
such that the derivative is proportional to the slope parameter $b$.
<!-- TODO: Connect this up to the efficiency $E$. -->
<!-- Next step is to answer in which section of the logistic curve does it look like the exponential? -->

The five-parameter logistic model (5PL) is similar to the four-parameter, but with an additional parameter $s$ which accounts for asymmetry of the curve
$$
n_c = n_\infty + \frac{n_0 - n_{\inf}}{\left(1 + (c / m)^b \right)^s}
$$

## Extension linking copies to fluorescence

The number of copies $n_c$ is connected to fluorescence data $f_t$ by some function $g$ such that $f_t \sim g(n_c)$.
For now, we will consider that this relationship is linear such that
$$
f_t = \beta_0 + \beta \cdot n_c 
$$
where $\beta_0$ is the background fluorescence and $\beta$ is the fluorescence produced by a single count.
The prior distributions $\beta_0 \sim p(\beta_0)$ and $\beta \sim p(\beta)$ may be determined by expert elicitation.

We observe $(f_0, \ldots, f_C)$ where $C$ is the total number of PCR cycles run.

## Extension to stochastic cycle times

Although each cycle is intended to run for one time step, it's possible this may not really be the case.
Instead, suppose that cycles $c = 1, \dots, C$ occur at times $t = t_1, \ldots, t_C$ with cycle time intervals $\kappa_c = t_{c + 1} - t_c$ between cycles.
A simple model for the intervals would be to have $\kappa_c \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_\kappa, {\sigma_\kappa}^2)$.
The interval mean could be fixed to one or have a prior centered at one.
Cycle times are recovered via the cumulative sum of intervals $t_c = \sum_{d < c} \kappa_d$.

## Extension to processing and dilution

<!-- [TODO: Diagram of processing and dilution] -->

Prior to amplification, we might consider a processing step where e.g DNA is released from inside the phage capsid.
Suppose that processing occurs independently between copies and is successful with probability $r$ drawn from some prior such as $r \sim \text{Beta}(a, b)$.
Then, during a further dilution step, a known fixed proportion $d \in [0, 1]$ of the copies are independently sampled, before being added to a known fixed amount of water.
<!-- [TODO: How to include the water in the model] -->
If the the number of copies of the virus retained is $n_0$, then we have
\begin{align}
r &\sim \text{Beta}(a, b), \\
n_0 &\sim \text{Binomial}(N_0, r d).
\end{align}
It's also possible that we assume $d = 1$ for simplicity. 

# Implementation

We will build and expand our model step-by-step using the Stan probabilistic programming language.

Primary inferential aims of our analysis may be to:

1. Infer $N_0$,
2. Infer $C_q$ for comparison against the value produced using conventional methods.

First start with the 4PL model plus a linear connection to fluorescence.
Simulate data from the model, setting `flag_run_estimation = 0`.
Then take the first simulated data, and attempt to infer the truth it was generated from.
Plot below contains prior on $f$ (blue), simulated fluorescence (circles), and inferred fluorescence (orange) based on the simulated data.
